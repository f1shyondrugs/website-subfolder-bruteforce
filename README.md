# Website Subfolder Bruteforce
A simple python program you give a link to and it automatically scans for subfiles/subfolders.

example link: https://example.com/

it will try different combinations with the wordlist (wordlist.txt is standard)
you can change the filenames as you want in the start.py
it will automatically write the results in the files like w404.txt, wforbidden.txt or wfound.txt

a result would be somthing like this:

1 FOUND: https://example.com/administrator

2 ERROR 404: https://example.com/idksomethingelse


maybe i'll add more features, but just test it ig
